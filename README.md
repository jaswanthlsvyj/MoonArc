# MoonArc: Real-Time Lunar Phase Detection
## Overview
MoonArc is a deep learning-based application designed to detect and classify lunar phases in real-time from uploaded or captured images. The project leverages a pre-trained deep learning model to identify moon phases and provides a user-friendly interface for both educational and practical purposes. Additionally, it includes a lunar calendar feature to offer historical and predictive insights about lunar phases.

## Features
- **Real-Time Lunar Phase Detection: Upload an image or capture one using your camera to detect the current lunar phase.**

- **Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow model for accurate classification.**

- **User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive experience.**

- **Lunar Calendar Integration: Provides historical and predictive lunar phase data.**

- **Multiple Use Cases: Useful for astronomy education, cultural practices, tide predictions, and biological studies.**

## Installation
To run MoonArc locally, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuskanKaushal11/MoonArc.git
cd MoonArc 
```

**2. Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
**3. Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Run the Application:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
**5. Access the Application:**

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.


## Usage
**1. Upload an Image:**

- Click on "Upload Image" and select an image of the moon from your device.

- The application will process the image and display the detected lunar phase.

**2. Open Camera:**

- Click on "Open Camera" to capture a real-time image using your device's camera.

- The application will process the captured image and display the detected lunar phase.
